# Ichiran

Ichiran is a collection of tools for working with text in Japanese language. It contains experimental segmenting and romanization algorithms and uses open source [JMdictDB](http://edrdg.org/~smg/) dictionary database to display meanings of words.

The web interface is under development right now. You can try it at [ichi.moe](http://ichi.moe).

## Installation

**!!!NEW!!!** There's now a [blog post](https://readevalprint.tumblr.com/post/639359547843215360/ichiranhome-2021-the-ultimate-guide) which contains detailed instructions how to get Ichiran running on Linux and Windows. It also describes how to use the new `ichiran-cli` command line interface!

1. Download JMDict data from [here](https://gitlab.com/yamagoya/jmdictdb/-/tree/master/jmdictdb/data). If you want to initialize database from scratch download [JMDict](ftp://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/JMdict.gz), and optionally [kanjidic2.xml](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/kanjidic2.xml.gz) to use ichiran/kanji functionality.
2. Create a settings.lisp file based on the provided settings.lisp.template file with the correct paths to the abovementioned files and the database connection parameters.
3. The code can be loaded as a regular ASDF system. Use quicklisp to easily install all the dependencies.
4. - Easy mode: Use database dump from [the release page](https://github.com/tshatrov/ichiran/releases) to create a suitable database. Make sure `settings.lisp` contains the correct connection parameters. Use `(ichiran/maintenance:add-errata)` to make database up to date.
   - Hard mode: Use `(ichiran/maintenance:full-init)` to completely initialize the database. Use `(ichiran/maintenance:load-jmdict)` followed by `(ichiran/maintenance:load-best-readings)` to initialize only `ichiran/dict` and not `ichiran/kanji`. Either way, this will take a few hours or so.
5. Use `(ichiran/test:run-all-tests)` to check that the installation satisfies the tests.
6. Before using any word segmenting functionality, run `(ichiran/dict:init-suffixes t)` to create a suffix cache, which will improve the quality of segmentation.

## Dockerized version

Build (executed from the root of this repo):

```
docker compose build
```

Start containers (this will take longer for the first time, because the db will get imported from the dump here, and other ichiran initializations will also get done here):

```
docker compose up
```

This will likely take several minutes, and may print a few warnings about pre-existing tables or WAL (write-ahead log) or vacuum tasks, which are safe to ignore. You may monitor the size of the database in another terminal via `du -h -d0 docker/pgdata` as it grows to around 4.7 GB. Eventually, the database will be fully restored and the `ichiran` container will start and say, "All set, awaiting commands."

If there were errors while importing db, or you want to import a new database you need to delete postgres data, so the postgres docker initdb scripts get called (if the folder is not empty it won't get called), and after this you can call `docker compose up` again:

```
sudo rm -rf docker/pgdata
```

$ docker exec -it ichiran-main-1 test-suite

There is no documentation yet. Any API is considered unstable at this point.

The basic functionality is `(ichiran:romanize "一覧は最高だぞ" :with-info t)`, but feel free to explore further.
